<h1>Pig Game</h1>

<b>Game Rules</b>
    Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
    <ul>
      <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
      <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
      <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
    </ul>
    The first player to score 100 or more points wins.<a href="https://vishnuvp257.github.io/pig-game/" target=" ">Link</a>
